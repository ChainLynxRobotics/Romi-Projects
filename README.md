# Romi-Projects
Learn how to make robots move with Romis by learning WPILib command-based programming. You're greatly encouraged to type out the code as you're working through the examples to get a deeper understanding of how robot code works.

## Task 1: Controlling Romi Drivetrain and Sensors
Control the Romi differential drivetrain by using its gyroscope and encoders to keep track of its position and rotation.

## Task 2: Basic Control Systems (PID) 
Implement PID to more precisely rotate and translate your robot to setpoints. 

## Task 3: Path Planning
Use Path Planner and its vendor dependency to control your robot in autonomous mode by configuring an Auto Builder.

## Task 4: Advantage Kit/Advantage Scope and In-Depth Logging
Create an abstraction between your hardware interface and your software commands to make your code more reusable and effectively log everything for quicker debugging.
